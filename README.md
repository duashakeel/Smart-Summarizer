The aim behind creating this project is to help students who have trouble reading long notes. The idea originally came during my preparation of IGCSE where I found reading and sustaining notes given by my teachers very difficult and time-consuming. During exams time is very crucial and should be used wisely. The summarizers I came across on the web were very complex and limited. Hence, with the help of python I created my own summarizer.

##  Features  

- Summarizes long text into concise points  
- Option to add **keywords** for focusing on important terms  
- GUI-based (Tkinter) ‚Üí easy to use  
- Commented code so others can understand and customize it

##  Installation  

Make sure Python is installed. Then run the following  to install dependencies:  

```bash 
pip install nltk
````
## Future Work
As I continue learning Python I plan to contritube more to this project and modify the following :
1. PDF output
2. Better algorithms

   

   ## This project is an open-source code to anybody wanting to use and modify it
